                <span class="emphasize">I am</span> certainly not the first person to raise questions about AI copyright; in fact, they have already been answered to some extent in court. In 2023, a district court in Washington,
                D.C., took the
                stance that AI-generated content cannot receive copyright protection. (Bondari) The court determined that only human beings are entitled to protections of their work under copyright
                law, emphasizing that human creativity is a fundamental requirement for copyright eligibility. Still, the ruling is not final; “The Copyright Office has clarified that if a human
                provides significant creative input—such as editing, arranging, or selecting AI-generated elements—a work might be eligible for copyright protection.” (Bondari) That clarification is
                important, because it draws a line between art that passively emerges from an algorithm and art that is actively shaped by a human mind. Yet, many would argue that using AI closes the
                gap between imagination and execution, offering those who cannot draw or compose music the chance to see their ideas realized. To that I say: “Skill issue.” More importantly, art has
                never been about producing the most polished or photorealistic product; it has always been about expression, about the imperfections and complexities that reveal a person's unique way
                of seeing the world. AI inherently does not have individuality. Its “style,” if we can even call it that, is the average of all human creation. In other words, AI art is not art at
                all, but a simulacrum of it. If you truly had ideas, but lacked a medium through which to express them, AI is not that medium, and probably never will be. So to copyright the creation
                of an algorithm which generates based on the rest of human creation would be a gross misunderstanding of the idea of copyright itself.

                Far more troubling in my opinion than people generating art, writing, and music using AI and passing it off as their own, is the issue
                of how these models are trained in the first place. An increasing number of lawsuits have accused companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Stability AI of building their tools on the works
                of
                artists and writers without their consent. In Andersen v. Stability AI, a group of artists alleged that Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt scraped billions of images from the
                internet—including their copyrighted works—to train platforms such as Stable Diffusion and DreamStudio. The court found these allegations sufficient to plead direct infringement,
                since
                the plaintiffs’ works were not just referenced, but stored or incorporated into the model itself as compressed copies. Similarly, in 2023, The New York Times sued OpenAI and
                Microsoft
                for using millions of its articles as training material without permission or compensation. (Bondari) These companies are making billions of dollars off the work of artists without
                their consent. If there has ever been a grander, more obvious violation of copyright, I’d be surprised.
