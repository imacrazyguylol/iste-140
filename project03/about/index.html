        <p class="bodyFont"><span class="emphasize">Hi!</span> I'm Liam Rowell, a first year student in the Computer Science program at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
            I'm an aspiring computer science researcher, and I have been programming for fun and curricular for about 5 years.
        </p>
        <p class="bodyFont">
            My hobbies include disc golf, snowboarding, and video games, among other seasonal activities. I'm always trying new things, whether it's a programming language or a sport, and that means
            I'm never truly in my comfort zone.
            For most, that would be a pain&mdash;but for me, what I live for is to be uncomfortable, because I believe that is the best way to experience the world.
        </p>
        <p class="bodyFont">
            I believe that AI is an incredible tool that will power the cutting edge of technology in the future. But currently, we don't live in that future, and the only thing it's powering is
            dehumanization and corruption.
            AI is not ready to reshape the world, nor will it tear it apart anytime soon. Right now it's being abused as a money mule by rich, powerful people who don't actually want what's best for
            society, rather than being
            honed into something that will actually make peoples' lives better. We have to fight for consumer rights and against the AI oligarchy if we want technology to continue to improve for
            current and future generations.
