    <p>
        The 2023 Adamawa State gubernatorial election took place on 18 March 2023, to elect the Governor of Adamawa
        State, concurrent with elections to the Adamawa State House of Assembly as well as twenty-seven other
        gubernatorial elections and elections to all other state houses of assembly.[1][2] The election — which was
        postponed from its original 11 March date — was held three weeks after the presidential election and National
        Assembly elections.[3] Incumbent Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri (PDP) was re-elected by a 3.75% margin over first
        runner-up and APC nominee — Senator Aishatu Dahiru Ahmed.[4]

    <h2>Electoral system</h2>
    <p>
        The Governor of Adamawa State is elected using a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a
        candidate must receive the plurality of the vote and over 25% of the vote in at least two-thirds of state local
        government areas. If no candidate passes this threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate
        and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government areas.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Adamawa State is a large, diverse northeastern state in the process of recovering from the worst of the Boko
        Haram insurgency. The state also has to contend with an underdeveloped yet vital agricultural sector and low
        education rates along with continued security challenges from Boko Haram and ISWAP to sustained conflict between
        herders and farmers.

        Politically, the 2019 Adamawa elections were a swing back to the PDP as its presidential nominee Atiku Abubakar
        won the state back from Buhari and Fintiri unseated APC Governor Bindo Jibrilla. Legislatively the PDP also
        gained ground, winning two Senate seats, five House of Representatives seats, and control of the House of
        Assembly. During Fintiri's term, his administration stated focuses included increased security, ethnic and
        religious harmony, and water resource management. In terms of his performance, Fintiri was commended for civil
        service reform while being criticized for having few accomplishments of his own and disregarding FAAN airport
        health protocols in July 2020.[18][19][20]

    <h2>Primary elections</h2>
    <p>
        The primaries, along with any potential challenges to primary results, were to take place between 4 April and 3
        June 2022 but the deadline was extended to 9 June.[2][21] According to some candidates and community leaders, an
        informal zoning gentlemen's agreement sets the Adamawa Central Senatorial District to have the next governor as
        since the 1999 return of democracy, all Adamawa governors have come from either the Adamawa South or Adamawa
        North Senatorial Districts. However, no major party has yet closed their primaries to candidates from the North
        or South.[22]
