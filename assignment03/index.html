            Wendy Carlos, born in 1939 in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, is an <strong>American composer and electronic musician.</strong> She studied physics and music at Brown University and later earned
            a master’s degree in composition at Columbia University. Trained as both a scientist and musician, Carlos developed a unique ability to merge technical experimentation with classical traditions. This dual
            background positioned her to become one of the earliest and most influential figures in electronic music, paving the way for the widespread acceptance of synthesizers in both popular and
            classical contexts.

            Carlos was instrumental in developing and popularizing the Moog synthesizer. Working closely with its inventor, Robert Moog, in the 1960s, she provided practical feedback that improved the
            instrument’s design. Her 1968 album Switched-On Bach, recorded entirely with the Moog, reinterpreted Johann Sebastian Bach’s music through electronic sound. The album was a commercial and
            critical success, winning three Grammy Awards and selling over a million copies. It demonstrated the synthesizer’s potential as a serious instrument and helped bring electronic music into
            the mainstream.

        <h3 class="headFont">Composing</h3>
        <p class="bodyFont">
            Beyond her role in electronic music, Carlos built a significant career as a composer. She created influential film scores for Stanley Kubrick’s A Clockwork Orange (1971) and The Shining
            (1980), as well as Disney’s Tron (1982). Her compositions combined classical structures with electronic textures, expanding the soundscape of cinema. Carlos also released albums such as Sonic
            Seasonings (1972), an early exploration of ambient music blending synthesized and natural sounds. Her body of work demonstrated both technical innovation and musical depth, establishing her as
            a central figure in late twentieth-century composition.

        <h3 class="headFont">Gender transitioning</h3>

        <p class="bodyFont">
            Carlos began her gender transition in the late 1960s, undergoing hormone therapy and later surgery at a time when transgender issues were rarely discussed publicly. For nearly a decade she
            kept her identity private, appearing in disguise during performances and interviews. In 1979, she publicly acknowledged her transition in an interview with Playboy. While she preferred
            attention on her music, Carlos’s openness made her one of the first prominent transgender figures in the arts. Her decision to live authentically was groundbreaking and contributed to
            greater visibility for transgender people in culture and music.
