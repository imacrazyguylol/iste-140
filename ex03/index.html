        <p>
            The 2023 Adamawa State gubernatorial election took place on 18
            March 2023, to elect the Governor of Adamawa
            State, concurrent with elections to the Adamawa State House of
            Assembly as well as twenty-seven other
            gubernatorial elections and elections to all other state houses
            of assembly. The election — which was
            postponed from its original 11 March date — was held three weeks
            after the presidential election and
            National
            Assembly elections. Incumbent Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri
            (PDP) was re-elected by a 3.75% margin over
            first
            runner-up and APC nominee — Senator Aishatu Dahiru Ahmed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The primaries, scheduled for between 4 April and 9 June 2022,
            resulted in Fintiri winning the Peoples
            Democratic
            Party primary unopposed on 26 May while the All Progressives
            Congress nominated Senator for Adamawa Central
            Aishatu Dahiru Ahmed on 25 May. Although a Federal High Court
            ruling nullified the APC primary on 14
            October, an Appeal Court judgment overturned the nullification
            and reinstated Ahmed on 24 November.
        </p>
        <p>
            The conduct of the general election was highly controversial
            with INEC failing to declare the results by 20
            March due to delays in counting due to logistical problems and
            attempted electoral interference. Later on 20
            March, INEC declared the election inconclusive; Fintiri and the
            PDP rejected the declaration, having already
            alleged a plot to rig the election in favour of Ahmed. The
            commission set the supplementary
            election
            on 15 April, along with other supplementary elections
            nationwide.
        </p>
        <p>
            As collation was still in progress on the early morning of 16
            April, INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner
            Hudu
            Ari declared Ahmed as the victor; the declaration led to
            immediate protest as the Resident Electoral
            Commissioner does not have the power to declare a winner,
            collation was incomplete, and Ari refused to give
            any
            data on the purported results. In response, the national INEC
            called Ari's declaration "null, void and
            of no
            effect" before summoning him to the INEC headquarters in Abuja
            and barring him from office. On 17
            April,
            returning officer Mohammed Mele declared the genuine results: in
            total, Fintiri obtained nearly 431,000
            votes
            and 50% of the vote as runner-up Ahmed received almost 399,000
            votes and 47% of the vote. The
            controversial
            and prolonged election process drew public outrage with critics
            calling the process a "new low" and "dance
            of
            shame" for INEC amid various other electoral controversies.
            Journalists noted potential credibility
            issues
            Fintiri could face due to the declaration scandal.

            <h2 class="headFont">Electoral system</h2>
            <p>
                The Governor of Adamawa State is elected using a modified
                two-round system. To be elected in the
                first
                round, a
                candidate must receive the plurality of the vote and over
                25% of the vote in at least two-thirds of
                state local
                government areas. If no candidate passes this threshold, a
                second round will be held between the top
                candidate
                and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes
                in the highest number of local
                government
                areas.

            <h2 class="headFont">Background</h2>
            <p>
                Adamawa State is a large, diverse northeastern state in the
                process of recovering from the worst of
                the
                Boko
                Haram insurgency. The state also has to contend with an
                underdeveloped yet vital agricultural sector
                and
                low
                education rates along with continued security challenges
                from Boko Haram and ISWAP to sustained
                conflict
                between
                herders and farmers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Politically, the 2019 Adamawa elections were a swing back to
                the PDP as its presidential nominee
                Atiku
                Abubakar
                won the state back from Buhari and Fintiri unseated APC
                Governor Bindo Jibrilla. Legislatively the
                PDP
                also
                gained ground, winning two Senate seats, five House of
                Representatives seats, and control of the
                House
                of
                Assembly. During Fintiri's term, his administration stated
                focuses included increased security,
                ethnic
                and
                religious harmony, and water resource management. In terms
                of his performance, Fintiri was commended
                for
                civil
                service reform while being criticized for having few
                accomplishments of his own and disregarding
                FAAN
                airport
                health protocols in July 2020.

            <h2 class="headFont">Primary elections</h2>
            <p>
                The primaries, along with any potential challenges to
                primary results, were to take place between 4
                April
                and 3
                June 2022 but the deadline was extended to 9 June. According
                to some candidates and community
                leaders, an
                informal zoning gentlemen's agreement sets the Adamawa
                Central Senatorial District to have the next
                governor
                as
                since the 1999 return of democracy, all Adamawa governors
                have come from either the Adamawa South or
                Adamawa
                North Senatorial Districts. However, no major party has yet
                closed their primaries to candidates
                from
                the
                North
                or South.

            <p>
                On 20 April 2022, the APC National Executive Committee
                announced the party's schedule for
                gubernatorial
                primaries, setting its expression of interest form price at
                ₦10 million and nomination form price at
                ₦40
                million
                with a 50% nomination form discount for candidates younger
                than 40 while women and candidates with
                disabilities
                get free nomination forms. Forms were to be sold from 26
                April to 6 May until the deadline was later
                extended to
                10 May then 12 May. After the submission of nomination forms
                by 13 May, candidates were screened
                by
                a
                party
                committee on 14 and 15 May while 16 May was the date for the
                screening appeal process. Ward
                congresses
                and
                LGA congresses were set for between 7 and 9 May to elect
                delegates for the primary. Candidates
                approved
                by
                the
                screening process advanced to a primary set for 26 May, in
                concurrence with other APC gubernatorial
                primaries;
                challenges to the result could be made the next day.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the primary date, the six candidates continued to an
                indirect primary in Yola that resulted in
                Aishatu
                Dahiru
                Ahmed—Senator for Adamawa Central and former member of the
                House of Representatives—emerging as the
                APC
                nominee
                after results showed her winning over 42% of the delegates'
                votes. Controversy arose during
                the
                primary
                when two of Ahmed's campaigners were arrested while caught
                bribing delegates and after the primary,
                accusation
                of overvoting led to internal debates. Later it was noted
                that Ahmed's nomination was the first time
                a
                woman
                had
                been nominated by a major party for the Adamawa governorship
                and only the second time a woman had
                been
                nominated
                by a major party for any state governorship. Post-primary
                analysis noted several failures
                from
                Ahmed's
                opponents and the success of Ahmed's campaign in picking off
                delegates expected to vote for others
                along
                with
                consolidating support from women delegates. However, about a
                month after the primary, first
                runner-up
                Nuhu
                Ribadu sued for the nullification of the primary based on
                the reports of vote-buying. Despite
                the
                court
                proceedings, Ahmed continued her campaign and picked Titsi
                Ganama—a fellow former House of
                Representatives
                member—as her running mate. On 14 October, Ribadu's suit was
                ruled on with Judge Abdulaziz Anka
                siding
                with
                Ribadu in invalidating Ahmed's nomination due to overvoting
                in the primary; however, Anka did not
                name
                Ribadu as
                nominee or order a rerun primary and instead rendered the
                APC without a nominee for the
                gubernatorial
                election. Ahmed announced her intention to appeal the
                judgment later that week and a Court of
                Appeal
                judgment
                on 24 November ruled in her favour, reinstating Ahmed as
                nominee. Although Ribadu originally
                announced
                his intention to take the case to the Supreme Court, he
                withdrew the lawsuit in early December "for
                the
                larger
                good of the party."
