            <p>The film popularized terms such as the red pill, and popularised a visual effect known as "bullet time", in which a character's heightened perception is represented by allowing the
                action within a shot to progress in slow motion while the camera appears to move through the scene at normal speed.</p>

            <p>The Matrix was also influential for its impact on superhero films. John Kenneth Muir in The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television called the film a "revolutionary"
                reimagination of movie visuals, paving the way for the visuals of later superhero films, and credits it with helping to "make comic-book superheroes hip".</p>
